# Context-Aware-Audio-Guidance-System-for-the-Visually-Impaired-
- It’s a wearable smart-glasses system designed to act as “eyes” for visually impaired people. The glasses will have a camera that continuously captures the surroundings and detects obstacles or objects in real time. 
- A Raspberry Pi will serve as the main processing unit. Based on what the camera detects and how far obstacles are, the system will generate contextual voicebguidance through earphones.
- Some hardware (like the Raspberry Pi and power supply) will be worn separately to keep the glasses
lightweight. The goal is to make a fast, reliable, and comfortable assistive device that helps the visually
impaired walk independently in real-world environments.
